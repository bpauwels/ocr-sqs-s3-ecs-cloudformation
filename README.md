# CloudFormation Templates for an example OCR service with Amazon ECS, SQS, and S3

## Overview

This repository contains CloudFormation templates to deploy an example OCR service on AWS using ECS, SQS and S3

The templates are based on the AWS reference architecture, see https://github.com/aws-samples/ecs-refarch-cloudformation

## Process

![process-overview](images/process-overview.png)

Images of scanned or photographed text can be uploaded in the web application. 
The files are transfered to a S3 bucket, which has a bucket notification configured that send as message to a SQS queue.
OCR worker containers poll the queue, recognize text and store the results in another S3 bucket.

## Infrastructure

![infrastructure-overview](images/architecture.png)

The repository consists of a set of nested templates that deploy the following:

 - A tiered [VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html) with public and private subnets, spanning an AWS region.
 - Two [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) buckets for input and output files, connected via a VPC Endpoint
 - A [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) fully managed message queue, receiving messages from the S3 input bucket when files are uploaded, connected via a VPC Endpoint
 - A highly available ECS cluster deployed across two [Availability Zones](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) in an [Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) group and that are AWS SSM enabled.
 - A pair of [NAT gateways](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) (one in each zone) to handle outbound traffic.
 - Two interconnecting microservices deployed as [ECS services](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) (website-service and product-service). 
 - An [Application Load Balancer (ALB)](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/applicationloadbalancer/) to the public subnets to handle inbound traffic.
 - ALB path-based routes for each ECS service to route the inbound traffic to the correct service.
 - Centralized container logging with [Amazon CloudWatch Logs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html).
 - A [Lambda Function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) and [Auto Scaling Lifecycle Hook](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html) to [drain Tasks from your Container Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-draining.html) when an Instance is selected for Termination in your Auto Scaling Group.
 - A [demo web application](https://github.com/bpauwels/aws-ocr-s3-frontend) running as ECS service, registered with the ALB
 - A [demo OCR worker application](https://github.com/bpauwels/nodejs-sqs-ocr) running as ECS service

Both, the web app and OCR workers scaled in and out based on the CPU utilization. This could be improved by scaling the OCR workers based on the SQS queue depth using a CloudWatch alarm.

## Template details

The templates below are included in this repository and reference architecture:

| Template | Description |
| --- | --- | 
| [master.yaml](master.yaml) | This is the master template - deploy it to CloudFormation and it includes all of the others automatically. |
| [infrastructure/vpc.yaml](infrastructure/vpc.yaml) | This template deploys a VPC with a pair of public and private subnets spread across two Availability Zones. It deploys an [Internet gateway](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html), with a default route on the public subnets. It deploys a pair of NAT gateways (one in each zone), and default routes for them in the private subnets. |
| [infrastructure/security-groups.yaml](infrastructure/security-groups.yaml) | This template contains the [security groups](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html) required by the entire stack. They are created in a separate nested template, so that they can be referenced by all of the other nested templates. |
| [infrastructure/sqs.yaml](infrastructure/sqs.yaml) | This template contains the SQS queue used to store the events for newly uploaded images that should be processed. It also contains the VPC endpoint for SQS |
| [infrastructure/s3.yaml](infrastructure/s3.yaml) | This template contains the S3 buckets used to store input and output files. It also contains the VPC endpoint for S3 |
| [infrastructure/load-balancers.yaml](infrastructure/load-balancers.yaml) | This template deploys an ALB to the public subnets, which exposes the various ECS services. It is created in in a separate nested template, so that it can be referenced by all of the other nested templates and so that the various ECS services can register with it. |
| [infrastructure/ecs-cluster.yaml](infrastructure/ecs-cluster.yaml) | This template deploys an ECS cluster to the private subnets using an Auto Scaling group and installs the AWS SSM agent with related policy requirements. |
| [infrastructure/lifecyclehook.yaml](infrastructure/lifecyclehook.yaml) | This template deploys a Lambda Function and Auto Scaling Lifecycle Hook to drain Tasks from your Container Instances when an Instance is selected for Termination in your Auto Scaling Group.
| [services/webapp-service/service.yaml](services/webapp-service/service.yaml) | This is the example web application, see [aws-ocr-s3-frontend](https://github.com/bpauwels/aws-ocr-s3-frontend) |
| [services/ocr-worker-service/service.yaml](services/ocr-worker-service/service.yaml) | This is the example ocr worker service, see [nodejs-sqs-ocr](https://github.com/bpauwels/nodejs-sqs-ocr) |

### Network

This set of templates deploys the following network design:

| Item | CIDR Range | Usable IPs | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VPC | 10.180.0.0/16 | 65,536 | The whole range used for the VPC and all subnets |
| Public Subnet | 10.180.8.0/21 | 2,041 | The public subnet in the first Availability Zone |
| Public Subnet | 10.180.16.0/21 | 2,041 | The public subnet in the second Availability Zone |
| Private Subnet | 10.180.24.0/21 | 2,041 | The private subnet in the first Availability Zone |
| Private Subnet | 10.180.32.0/21 | 2,041 | The private subnet in the second Availability Zone |
